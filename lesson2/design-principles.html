        <h3>Repetition and Contrast</h3>
        <h4>Apple</h4>
        <a href="">apple.com</a>

          I think this page shows a good use of both <em>repetition</em> and
          <em>contrast</em>. Repeating the phones on both the top and the bottom
          of the page as well as the lines of text in the middle as kind of
          mirrors of eachother. Also the contrast between the colors of the text
          and the sizing really make the <em>iPhone 13</em> stand out. Each of
          the different colors for every bit of text makes it part of the whole
          but also stand on its own.

        <h3>Proximity</h3>
        <h4>Nike</h4>
        <a href="">nike.com</a>
        <picture
          ><img
            src="https://swpowe.github.io/wdd230-WebFrontEndDev/lesson2/images/nike.png"

          On this page <em>proximity</em> is what really stood out. The way the page is divided into sections and you have the top menu and navigation seperated from the store aspect at the bottom. You're able to school through different sections of the store and then see those results at the bottom. Bottons for filtering are close to the results allowing you to refine your search.

        <h3>Rule of Thirds and Spacing</h3>
        <h4>Spitfire Audio</h4>
        <a href="">spitfireaudio.com</a>
        <picture
          ><img
            src="https://swpowe.github.io/wdd230-WebFrontEndDev/lesson2/images/spitfire2.png"
            alt="apple company website screenshot"
        /></picture>
        <p>
          I like how this page used the <em>rule of thirds</em> with the organ image as the background. Also using a gradient with the <em>white space</em> and simple text allows you to see the organ in the background image matching the library title <em>Symphonic Organ</em>.
